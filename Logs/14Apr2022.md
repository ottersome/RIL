# Intro

After midterm week I finally have time to work more on  the project.
I will begin by porting my work on matrices from the third project over to here.

I want to start with the simplest of task and see if I can get that over with. 
This would be the convolution of matrices and perhaps visualization. I want to see if 
I can merge it together with either opencv or pyplot so as to visualize the images that I
generate.
(This would help me with the doubts I have on my img procesing/ comp vision class lol)

# TODOs

- [ ] Port Code from HW3
- [ ] Create Kernel Class
- [ ] Create CMakeFile for the sake of cross-platform compatibility
